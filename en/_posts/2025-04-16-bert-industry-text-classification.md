### ðŸ§  Study Overview

In the study, we applied the **BERT-BASE-TURKISH-UNCASED** model to classify web-scraped content into **42 different industry categories**, including education, cosmetics, rent-a-car, packaging, and more.

- The training data included 101,000 samples from labeled URLs.
- Fine-tuned on previously labeled Turkish ad text.
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **Accuracy**: 0.98 (high general success)
- **Average F1-Score** for 12 top-performing categories: **0.67**
- Top categories included *Flower Order*, *Packaging*, *Foreign Language Education*, and *Rent a Car*.

The BERT model showed impressive results, especially when the training data for a category exceeded 1000 samples. However, it also revealed limitations in recall and precision, especially for underrepresented categories.
